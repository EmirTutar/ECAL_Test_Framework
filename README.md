# eCAL Test Framework

This repository contains an automated integration test framework for [eCAL](https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/ecall). It is designed to run and validate communication scenarios between multiple processes using eCAL middleware.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to provide:

* Automated test runs on push, pull request, or schedule
* Reliable feedback on message communication and process stability
* Visual test reports for easy inspection

## Features

* Supports multiple eCAL transport layers (SHM, UDP, TCP)
* Covers common scenarios such as:

  * Publisher to Subscriber communication
  * Multi-publisher and multi-subscriber setups
  * Fault injection (e.g., crashing subscribers or publishers)
  * Network failure simulations
* Test results are published to GitHub Pages
* Integration in eCAL repositori via `repository_dispatch`

## Test Scenarios

Each test case is implemented using [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), with Docker-based isolation.

Available scenarios include:

* `basic_pub_sub`
* `multi_pub_sub`
* `network_crash`
* `pub_crash`
* `sub_crash`
* `sub_send_crash`
* and more...

## Test Reports

Test results are automatically deployed to:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://emirtutar.github.io/ECAL\_Test\_Framework](https://emirtutar.github.io/ECAL_Test_Framework)

Each run is timestamped and archived, with access to:

* `log.html`
* `report.html`
* `output.xml`

## Triggering Tests

Tests can be triggered in three ways:

1. Manually via GitHub Actions
2. Automatically from the main eCAL repository using `repository_dispatch`
3. It is triggered with daily schedule (e.g., 05:00 UTC)

## Feedback to eCAL Repo

After the test run finishes, the result (pass/fail) is reported back to the original commit in the eCAL repository as a commit status.

## Requirements

* eCAL (If you build without Docker)
* Docker
* Python 3
* Robot Framework
